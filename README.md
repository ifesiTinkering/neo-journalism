|--------------|-------|---------------------|

## Understanding the Market Dynamics

The battle was between **"25 bps cut" vs "No change"**, NOT between different cut sizes:

```
The real battle:

   "25 bps cut"  ←──────→  "No change"
      (dovish)              (hawkish)
```

- **Hawks** (Bostic, Collins, Schmid, Logan): Inflation at 3% is too high; hold rates steady
- **Doves** (Waller, Williams, Miran): Labor market weakening; cut 25 bps for insurance

The 50+ bps cut option stayed near 0% throughout — never in play.
